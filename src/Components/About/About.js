          <p>
            Hello friend, my name is Branimir BeliÄ‡, I live in Zagreb, Croatia
            and I love coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from{" "}

            in 2017, I specialized in Databases and Web design, and got bacc.

          <p>
            In the last few months of college along with learning web design I
            started to get more and more interested in game design and{" "}
            <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity3D</a>. After I got familiar with
            it I finished my first simple 3D video game called{" "}
            <a href="https://bazzix.itch.io/amazing-maze">Amazing Maze</a>.
            There were a lot of obstacles on the way, but I pushed through.
          </p>
          <p>
            I became more interested in web design again and I started to learn
            Javascript. Eventually, I stumbled upon{" "}
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> and I was immediately
            interested in it. Ever since I'm learning more and more. I
            understand there is still a long way ahead of me to learn as much as
            I can, but I don't mind, it will be fun experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time I like to be outdoors and do things like hiking or
            playing some team sport with friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, ReactJS and GitHub.
