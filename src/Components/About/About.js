          Hello, my name is Branimir BeliÄ‡, I live in Zagreb, Croatia and I love
          coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work as an Operations / IT administrator in{" "}

          , but my goal is to become excellent front-end web developer.

          I graduated from{" "}

        <p>
          In the last few months of college along with learning responsive
          design I started to get more and more interested in game design and{" "}

          Eventually I stumbled upon <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>{" "}
          and I was blown away by it's simplicity and abilities of it's
